### Note
- I'm really really *bad* at <u>data structures</u> & <u>algorithms</u>.
    > So, I'm actually kinda *re-learn* all of these completely from the basics while reading this book. That brings my main point, I know the code here is not *that* good, and not *that* comprehend, but I believe these notes & implementations could serve as a great starting point for learning the **basics** of algorithms, most of them is **self-contained** <small>(yep)</small>.
