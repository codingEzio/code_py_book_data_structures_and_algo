### Where to find *good* implementations for learning
- repos like [al-go-rithms](https://github.com/ZoranPandovski/al-go-rithms) <small>(collections of algorithms)</small>
- Websites like these
    - [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
    - [dev.to](https://dev.to)
    - and more
- And.. [*npm packages*](https://www.npmjs.com)!
    - e.g. [*Splay tree*](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=splay%20tree)
    - These implementations tend to be *much* *much* better than most of the tutorials <small>(ah, just my assumption)</small>
    - One more thing, some of them do have *extremely nice* documentations! See [here](https://github.com/pedrolopesme/jsplay)
