### Chapter Goals
> By the end of this chapter, you should be able to answer these questions.
- When presented with an algorithm that requires you to maintain a sequence of data, which organizational scheme fits best?
- What are the trade-offs of selecting one type of sequence as opposed to another?
- What are some interesting algorithms that use lists, linked lists, stacks, or queues?
- What sorting algorithm is most commonly used when sorting a sequence of ordered values?
- What search algorithms are possible in a sequence?
- What is the complexity of many of the common operations on sequences and how is that complexity affected by the underlying organization of the data.
