### Chapter Goals
> In this chapter you learn how to implement a couple of abstract datatypes: sets and maps. You will read about the importance of hashing for both of these datatypes. Youâ€™ll also learn about the importance of understanding the difference between muta- ble and immutable data. By the end of the chapter you should be able to answer these questions.
- What is the complexity of finding a value in a set?
- What is the load factor and how does it affect the overall efficiency of lookup in
a hash table?
- When would you use an immutable set?
- When might you want a mutable set?
- When is there an advantage to using memoization in a problem?
- Under what circumstances can it be useful to use a map or dictionary?
